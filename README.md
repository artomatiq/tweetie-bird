## Tweety Bird: The X-scape

This project is a ——Twitter vs Elon Musk's X—— rivalry themed clone of the popular game Flappy Bird developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

It aims to replicate Flappy Bird's addictive gameplay of guiding a bird through a series of obstacles by tapping/pressing to keep it airborne.

In this version, the bird is the Twitter logo, while the obstacles are Space-X's Starships. The game is naturally set in the Martian landscape, with blue Earth towering over the horizon. 



## How to Play

1. Run the game from your Browser.
2. Press Enter to start the game.
3. Press Space to make the bird flap its wings and rise.
4. Avoid the Starhip obstacles by flying through the gaps.
5. Try to get the highest score possible!
